# Optimization using Neural Network

Performs constrained optimization using neural network with PyTorch.  
To install pytorch: `pip install torch` 

## Description of files
Objective function and constraints are included in `objective_function.py` and `constraints.py`. File `optimization_neural_network.py` calls the function in `train_objfunc.py` to train the objective function and runs optimization using neural network.
